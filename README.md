# Liam

**Liam** is an ad manager for LinkedIn and Google Ads. Create campaigns by talking
to Claude (MCP) or from a CLI. Built for go-to-market teams who want to spin up many
campaigns from a contact list and a brief, then add creative images themselves. Nothing
is ever created live: LinkedIn entities are **drafts**, Google entities are **paused**,
and there is no activate tool on either platform, so nothing spends until you turn it on
yourself.

> Unofficial and not affiliated with or endorsed by LinkedIn or Google.

> Covers creation, matched audiences (including building one straight from Salesforce),
> conversion selection, performance reporting/insights, competitor ad intelligence, and a
> change journal with before/after lift. See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for what's shipped
> and what's planned next.

## What you can do with it

Once Liam is connected, you talk to your assistant in plain language. Real requests it
handles today, roughly in the order a campaign comes together:

- "How many VPs of demand gen at US SaaS companies can we reach?" (resolves targeting
  facets, estimates reach before any money is involved)
- "Upload this CSV as a matched audience." (auto-cleans columns, hashes emails, converts
  company domains to URLs)
- "Build an audience from Salesforce: every contact on an account flagged as a target."
  (SOQL straight to a matched audience)
- "Launch a draft campaign for that audience, $100/day, tracking the demo-booked
  conversion." (campaign group + campaign + draft ads in one call)
- "What ads is HubSpot running right now, and what offers are they pushing?" (reads the
  public Ad Library: copy, formats, and EU targeting metadata for any company)
- "How did retargeting do last month vs the month before?" (trend report with deltas)
- "Which ads should I pause this week?" (account rollup with top/bottom performers and
  flags)
- "Rewrite the copy on the losing ad." (delete + recreate as a fresh draft; LinkedIn
  ignores edits to a live ad's post)
- "Did the new headline actually help?" (change journal + before/after lift)

Liam resolves the details and reports back the ids. Every capability is also a `liam`
CLI command for scripted or batch use.

### Put it on a loop

There is no scheduler in Liam. Use the one in whatever client you drive it from.
Some loops that work well:

- "Every Monday at 9am, pull last week's performance summary, compare it to the week
  before, and flag anything that moved more than 20%." (a Claude Code scheduled agent)
- "Every Friday, check what new ads our top three competitors shipped this week and
  summarize the angles."
- "Check the audience match status every few hours and tell me when it clears 300
  members." (the minimum for a matched audience to serve)
- Or skip the assistant entirely and put the CLI in cron:
  `0 9 * * 1 liam report summary -p last_7_days`

## Hierarchy mapping (the two platforms disagree)

LinkedIn's names are shifted one level from everyone else's, which is the single
most common source of confusion when working across both:

| Common term | LinkedIn entity    | Google Ads entity | Holds                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Campaign    | **Campaign Group** | —                 | status, total/shared budget              |
| Ad group    | **Campaign**       | **Campaign**      | targeting, budget, bid, schedule, format |
| —           | —                  | **Ad group**      | keywords and the ads that answer them    |
| Ad          | **Creative**       | **Ad group ad**   | the rendered ad                          |
| Audience    | **DMP Segment**    | **User list**     | attached to targeting                    |

So a LinkedIn "campaign" and a Google "campaign" are not the same thing: Google's
campaign holds the budget and targeting (LinkedIn's *campaign group* plus
*campaign*), and its ad group holds keywords.

## Google Ads

Search campaigns only, creation-first. What is there today:

```bash
liam google auth login
liam google accounts list                       # proves the token and OAuth client work
liam google keywords "revops automation" --url https://www.default.com/platform
liam google conversions list
liam google launch --brief examples/google-brief.json           # dry run
liam google launch --brief examples/google-brief.json --apply   # create it, paused
liam google campaigns list
liam google report perf keyword -p last_30_days
```

A launch creates the budget, campaign, geo and language targeting, ad groups,
keywords, and responsive search ads in **one atomic mutate**: it either lands
whole or not at all, so a failure cannot leave half a campaign behind. Every
write is validated server-side first, which is a genuine dry run rather than a
local guess.

Three house rules are hard-coded, because all three default the wrong way in the
UI and quietly waste B2B budget:

- **Search network only.** Display expansion and search partners off.
- **Physical presence only.** "US" means people in the US, not people anywhere
  who searched about it.
- **Manual CPC to start.** Smart bidding with no conversion history spends
  unpredictably. Switch in the UI once there is data.

### Setup

Google Ads needs two things LinkedIn does not:

1. **A developer token**, from a Google Ads **manager (MCC)** account at
   [ads.google.com/aw/apicenter](https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter). A plain
   client account cannot issue one. Approval usually lands on **Explorer** access
   automatically (2,880 production ops/day).

   **Explorer is not enough for `liam google keywords`.** Explorer blocks
   KeywordPlanService, so keyword research needs **Basic** access (15,000
   ops/day), which is a separate application on the same screen. Campaign
   creation and reporting work fine on Explorer.
2. **An OAuth client**, from a Google Cloud project with the Google Ads API
   enabled. Use the "Desktop app" type, which accepts any `localhost` redirect.

   For the consent screen, **do not leave it in "Testing"** — that status issues
   refresh tokens that stop working after 7 days. Beyond that it is a trade:

   - **Internal** (Workspace orgs only) is what Google's OAuth docs recommend for
     a single-company tool. Simplest, no verification, no 7-day expiry.
   - **External + In production** is the precondition for *brand verification*,
     the pilot that cuts Basic Access review from days to hours. The cost is that
     `auth/adwords` is a **sensitive** scope, so a published external app can
     require full OAuth app verification — potentially slower than the wait it
     saves.

   Internal is the better default for an internal tool. Choose External only if
   the fast track is worth the verification risk.

Then write `~/.liads/google.json`:

```json
{
  "clientId": "....apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "clientSecret": "...",
  "developerToken": "...",
  "loginCustomerId": "1234567890",
  "defaultCustomerId": "0987654321",
  "defaultConversionActionNames": ["Demo Booked"]
}
```

`loginCustomerId` is the manager account and is only needed when you reach the
target account through one. Run `liam google auth login` and you are set.

## Packages

- `@liads/shared`: the platform-neutral layer — OAuth, credential stores, retry policy, the change journal, period and KPI math.
- `@liads/core`: LinkedIn REST client, resource modules, CSV + SHA256 hashing, Salesforce reader.
- `@liads/google`: Google Ads REST client, GAQL reads, atomic mutate builder, Search campaign creation.
- `@liads/mcp`: MCP server (stdio for local; reused by the hosted app). **Primary interface.**
- `@liads/cli`: the `liam` CLI over the same engines, for scripted batch runs.
- `@liads/web`: Next.js app that hosts the MCP over HTTP on Vercel.

## How it works

Both interfaces are thin layers over the same engine. Every MCP tool and CLI command builds
a client via `createLiads()` (`core/src/client.ts`), which loads config plus an
auto-refreshing OAuth token provider, then calls a typed resource module
(`campaigns.ts`, `audience.ts`, `report.ts`, ...) that wraps LinkedIn's versioned REST API
(`LinkedIn-Version` pinned in config). Input shapes live as zod schemas in
`core/src/schemas.ts` and are reused verbatim as the MCP tool input schemas, so the CLI and
MCP can never drift apart.

The draft-only safety rule is enforced at creation: campaign groups, campaigns, and
creatives are all written with `DRAFT` status, and there is deliberately no "activate"
tool or command. Every write also passes through one HTTP chokepoint that appends to a
local change journal (`~/.liads/changelog.jsonl`) for later lift analysis.

[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) has the full architecture notes and the LinkedIn API gotchas
(restli encoding, required fields, DMP audience flow) learned from live testing.

## Install

There are two ways to install Liam:

1. **[As an MCP server](#option-1-install-as-an-mcp-server)**, registered with Claude
   Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP client, so you create campaigns by talking
   to your assistant. Run it locally, or skip the always-on install entirely and
   [connect to the hosted endpoint with your own credentials](#hosted-mcp-connect-with-your-own-credentials-nothing-to-deploy).
2. **[As a terminal CLI](#option-2-install-the-terminal-cli)**, a global `liam` command
   for running everything from your terminal, scripts, or cron.

Both run against **your own LinkedIn developer app**, so your credentials and your ad
account stay yours. The first two steps are shared: create a LinkedIn app (step 0) and
build + authenticate (step 1). After that, pick your path, or do both; they read the
same `~/.liads` credentials.

### Step 0: create a LinkedIn app (once)

1. Create an app at https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps. It must be associated
   with your company's LinkedIn Page.
2. On the **Products** tab, request access:

   | Product | Needed for | Required? |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Advertising API | campaigns, ads, targeting, reporting, conversions | **Yes** |
   | Audiences | uploading CSV contact/company lists as matched audiences | Only for audience upload |
   | LinkedIn Ad Library | competitor ad metadata via the official API | Required for competitor discovery; no browser fallback |

3. On the **Auth** tab, add `http://localhost:53682/callback` as an authorized redirect
   URL, and note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
4. Once the Advertising API is approved, map your ad account under
   **Products → Advertising API → View Ad Accounts**. Skip this and `accounts list`
   comes back empty.

**OAuth scopes.** `liam auth login` requests `rw_ads` (create and edit campaigns),
`r_ads_reporting` (reporting), `rw_conversions` (conversion tracking), and
`w_organization_social` (image ads create a post owned by your LinkedIn Page). If you add
a product or scope later, run `auth login` again; a token refresh keeps only the scopes
you originally granted.

### Step 1: build and authenticate (once, both paths)

Requires git, Node.js 20+, and pnpm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stan-default/liam.git
cd liam
pnpm install && pnpm -r build

# App credentials (alternatively set LIADS_CLIENT_ID / LIADS_CLIENT_SECRET env vars)
mkdir -p ~/.liads
echo '{ "clientId": "...", "clientSecret": "...", "linkedinVersion": "202605" }' > ~/.liads/config.json

node packages/cli/dist/index.js auth login      # opens the browser; tokens land in ~/.liads
node packages/cli/dist/index.js accounts list   # verify, then set defaultAccountId in config.json
```

### Option 1: install as an MCP server

Register the server with your MCP client; it reads the `~/.liads` credentials from step 1.

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add liam -- node /abs/path/liam/packages/mcp/dist/index.js
```

**Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP client**, in its MCP config JSON:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "liam": { "command": "node", "args": ["/abs/path/liam/packages/mcp/dist/index.js"] }
  }
}
```

Ask for something read-only to confirm it works: "List my ad accounts" or "How did my
account do in the last 30 days?"

#### Hosted MCP: connect with your own credentials, nothing to deploy

The hosted MCP server at

```
https://liam-mcp.vercel.app/api/mcp
```

is **multi-tenant, bring-your-own-credentials**: you pass your LinkedIn developer app's
details as request headers, and every call runs against *your* app and *your* ad account.
The server holds no state for you: credentials are used in memory to call LinkedIn and
never logged or persisted.

| Header | Value | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `X-Liads-Client-Id` | your LinkedIn app's Client ID | Yes |
| `X-Liads-Client-Secret` | your LinkedIn app's Client Secret | Yes |
| `X-Liads-Refresh-Token` | a refresh token from your `auth login` (~365d) | Yes |
| `X-Liads-Account-Id` | numeric ad account id used when a call omits one | No |
| `X-Liads-Linkedin-Version` | API version pin (YYYYMM), defaults to the server's | No |

Do step 0 and step 1 above once (the LinkedIn app and the local `auth login`; LinkedIn's
OAuth consent has to happen in your browser, so the token mint is the one local step).
Then print the ready-to-run connect command:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js auth export --mcp
# claude mcp add --transport http liam https://liam-…vercel.app/api/mcp \
#   --header "X-Liads-Client-Id: …" \
#   --header "X-Liads-Client-Secret: …" \
#   --header "X-Liads-Refresh-Token: …" \
#   --header "X-Liads-Account-Id: …"
```

Any MCP client that supports custom headers works the same way (for clients without
native HTTP transport: `npx mcp-remote <url> --header "X-Liads-Client-Id: …" …`).
Verify with a read-only call ("list my ad accounts"), and from then on the connection is
just a URL plus headers, usable from machines that never cloned this repo.

Know the trade-off: your client secret and refresh token travel with every request to
that server, so only point them at a deployment you trust, or self-host the identical
endpoint (next section). The scopes they carry can manage ads but never activate them;
the draft-only rule is enforced in the tool layer itself.

Hosted limitations (all by design, they need local resources): `upload_audience_csv`
reads a CSV path on the server, `audience_from_salesforce` needs your local `sf` CLI,
competitor-ads scraping falls back to API-only metadata (no browser), and the change
journal / lift tools need the local `~/.liads/changelog.jsonl`. Run those through the
local MCP server or CLI.

**Put a skill on top.** The clean split for teams: your MCP client's config holds the
credentials (the headers above), and a small skill or system prompt holds your playbook:
default ad account, naming conventions, standing exclusions, house rules like "audience
expansion always off". The [`skills/`](./skills) folder in this repo is a working example;
copy one, swap in your defaults, and your assistant drives the hosted tools with your
rules. Credentials never belong in a skill file.

#### Self-host the same endpoint on Vercel

Run your own instance so credentials never touch shared infrastructure, and so you also
get a private env-configured tenant:

1. Get your env values locally: `node packages/cli/dist/index.js auth export`.
2. Deploy `apps/web` to Vercel (set the project **Root Directory** to `apps/web`).
3. In Vercel project settings, add the env vars from `.env.example`
   (`LIADS_CLIENT_ID`, `LIADS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LIADS_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `LIADS_LINKEDIN_VERSION`,
   and a strong `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`). In Vercel's Deployment Protection settings, disable
   Vercel Authentication for production (or add a protection-bypass secret); otherwise
   MCP clients can't reach the endpoint.
4. Your MCP endpoint is `https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/mcp`. Connect with the secret
   in the header:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http liam https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

Requests carrying `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` use the env credentials (your tenant). Requests
carrying the `X-Liads-*` headers above use the caller's credentials instead, so one
self-hosted instance can serve your whole team, each member on their own LinkedIn app.

### Option 2: install the terminal CLI

Step 1 already left a working CLI at `node packages/cli/dist/index.js`. To get a global
`liam` command instead of the long `node` path:

```bash
cd packages/cli && pnpm link --global
liam accounts list
```

(No pnpm link? An alias works too: `alias liam="node /abs/path/liam/packages/cli/dist/index.js"`.)

A sensible first session:

```bash
liam targeting search titles "demand generation"   # resolve targeting URNs
liam report summary -p last_30_days                # account rollup + flags
liam launch --brief examples/brief.json            # creates DRAFTS only
```

The full [CLI reference](#cli-reference) is below.

### Or paste this prompt and let your assistant do the setup

Copy the whole block into Claude (or any capable assistant with terminal access) and it
will walk you through everything above, one step at a time:

```text
You are helping me set up Liam, an open-source LinkedIn Ad Manager from
https://github.com/stan-default/liam. It runs locally as an MCP server and a CLI.
Everything it creates on LinkedIn is a draft, so nothing spends money until I
activate it myself in Campaign Manager.

Walk me through the setup one step at a time. Run commands for me where you can,
show me exactly what to click where you cannot, and wait for my confirmation
before moving to the next step.

1. Check that git, Node.js 20 or newer, and pnpm are installed. Help me install
   whatever is missing.
2. Clone https://github.com/stan-default/liam and run "pnpm install" then
   "pnpm -r build" in the repo root.
3. Help me create a LinkedIn developer app at
   https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps (it must be associated with my
   company's LinkedIn Page):
   a. On the Products tab, request access to the "Advertising API" product.
      This is the only required product; approval can take a while.
   b. Optional: also request "Audiences" if I want to upload CSV contact or
      company lists as matched audiences.
   c. Optional: also request "LinkedIn Ad Library" if I want competitor ad
      metadata through the official API.
   d. On the Auth tab, add http://localhost:53682/callback as an authorized
      redirect URL, and show me where the Client ID and Client Secret live.
4. Create ~/.liads/config.json containing my clientId, clientSecret, and
   "linkedinVersion": "202605".
5. Run "node packages/cli/dist/index.js auth login". My browser opens LinkedIn's
   consent screen; after I approve, tokens are stored in ~/.liads/credentials.json.
6. Verify with "node packages/cli/dist/index.js accounts list". If no accounts
   show up, remind me to map my ad account in the Developer Portal under
   Products > Advertising API > View Ad Accounts. Then set my account id as
   "defaultAccountId" in ~/.liads/config.json.
7. Register the MCP server with the assistant I use:
   - Claude Code: claude mcp add liam -- node <abs repo path>/packages/mcp/dist/index.js
   - Claude Desktop or another client: add {"command": "node", "args":
     ["<abs repo path>/packages/mcp/dist/index.js"]} under mcpServers in its config.
8. Confirm the tools load, then show me one read-only call working, for example
   list_ad_accounts or a last_30_days performance summary.

If any step fails, show me the exact error and fix it with me before moving on.
```

## Skills: playbooks on top of Liam

The [`skills/`](./skills) directory ships ten portable agent skills that turn Liam's
raw tools into opinionated workflows. Each encodes a methodology (what to pull, how to
judge it, significance floors, caveats, a fixed report format) and works over MCP or
the CLI. Analysis and monitoring skills are read-only; the operating skills create
drafts only, after confirmation.

Analyze:

- **liam-spend**, "analyze my spend": budget concentration, wasted spend, reallocation moves
- **liam-performance**, "how are my ads doing": winners, losers, fatigue, actions
- **liam-leads**, "which ads drive leads, which don't": drivers, pause list, angle patterns
- **liam-competitors**, "what is `<company>` running": Ad Library teardown and gaps

Monitor:

- **liam-weekly**, "weekly snapshot": fixed-format week-over-week digest, schedule-friendly
- **liam-health**, "anything on fire": silent-unless-fire daily guardrails, one line when all clear

Operate:

- **liam-launch**, "launch a campaign": brief to confirmed draft with house guardrails applied
- **liam-experiments**, "did that change help": hypothesis logging plus before/after lift
- **liam-audiences**, "audit my audiences": health, dry-run uploads, Salesforce refresh loop
- **liam-account-audit**, "is my account set up right": hygiene scorecard and fix list

```bash
./skills/install.sh   # symlinks them into ~/.claude/skills (Claude Code personal skills)
```

See [skills/README.md](./skills/README.md) for details and conventions.

## Tools (MCP)

- **Accounts:** `list_ad_accounts`
- **Targeting:** `list_targeting_facets`, `search_targeting` (typeahead a facet for entity URNs),
  `list_facet_entities`, `estimate_audience` (structured spec). Talk in plain language
  ("VPs of demand gen at SaaS companies in the US") and Liam resolves the facets and
  estimates reach before building the campaign.
- **Audiences:** `upload_audience_csv` (auto-cleans the CSV: normalizes column names, drops
  non-matcher columns, hashes emails, converts company domains to website URLs; supports both
  contact and company lists), `audience_from_salesforce` (SOQL to matched audience), `get_audience_status`
- **Conversions:** `list_conversions` (select an existing insight-tag conversion to track).
  `create_campaign` and `launch_from_brief` accept `conversionIds` or `conversionName`, and
  fall back to `defaultConversionName` from config.
- **Campaigns:** `create_campaign_group`, `create_campaign`, `create_text_ad`, `create_image_ad`;
  `list_campaigns` (the account structure: campaign groups and their ad groups, **drafts
  included**, unlike reporting which only shows entities with spend), `list_ads`, `delete_ad`
  (removes the creative and best-effort its Direct Sponsored Content post). LinkedIn's editor
  ignores post edits on a live ad, so to change copy you recreate: `delete_ad` + `create_image_ad`.
- **Orchestrator:** `launch_from_brief` (audience + group + campaign + draft creatives in one call)
- **Reporting:** `performance_summary` (account rollup + top/bottom + flags), `get_performance`
  (per-entity KPIs at any level), `performance_trend` (weekly/monthly with deltas). KPIs: CTR,
  CPC, CPM, CPL, conversion rate, cost per conversion. Levels: campaign_group, campaign, creative.
- **Competitor intel:** `inspect_competitor_ads` uses the official Ad Library API for
  metadata and, in `auto` mode, an optional remote worker for creative copy and screenshots.
  No CLI or MCP code launches a local browser or falls back to scraping when the API fails.
  Supply both `advertiser` and `companyId` to filter broad API matches before queuing creatives.
  `api` mode is metadata only. `auto` queues at most 10 ads and returns cached results or job
  status; use `get_competitor_creatives` / `liam creative-status <ids>` to read completed jobs.
  The worker persists its cache, queue, rolling budgets and block state. See
  [Remote creative worker](services/creative-worker/README.md) for deployment and configuration.
- **Change journal & lift:** `log_ad_change` (record a change), `list_ad_changes`, `compute_lift`
  (before-vs-after performance for each recorded change). Liam auto-journals every change it makes;
  see [Change journal & lift](#change-journal--lift) below.

### Targeting spec

Structured targeting uses short facet names mapped to entity URNs (resolve URNs with
`search_targeting`). URNs within a facet are ORed; facets are ANDed; excluded facets are ORed.

```json
{ "include": { "locations": ["urn:li:geo:103644278"], "seniorities": ["urn:li:seniority:7"], "titles": ["urn:li:title:26587"] },
  "exclude": { "industries": ["urn:li:industry:47"] } }
```

## CLI reference

All commands also work via `node packages/cli/dist/index.js <cmd>`.

```
liam auth login                         # OAuth, stores tokens in ~/.liads
liam auth export                        # print env vars for a self-hosted (Vercel) server
liam auth export --mcp                  # print the hosted-MCP connect command with your headers
liam accounts list                      # list accessible ad accounts
liam targeting search <facet> <query>   # typeahead a facet for entity URNs
liam targeting estimate <facet> <urns…> # audience size for one facet's URNs
liam audience upload -n <name> -f <csv> # clean + upload a CSV as a matched audience
liam audience upload -n <name> -f <csv> --dry-run   # preview the cleaned CSV, no upload
liam audience from-salesforce -n <name> -q "<SOQL>"   # Salesforce query -> matched audience

liam ad delete <creativeId>             # delete an ad (creative + its DSC post)
liam report summary [-p <period>]       # account rollup: totals, top performers, flags
liam report perf <level> [--parent <id>] # per-entity KPI rows
liam report trend <level> <id> [-b weekly|monthly]  # trend with deltas
liam launch --brief <brief.json>        # audience + group + campaign + draft creatives
liam competitor ads <advertiser>        # any company's ads from the public Ad Library
                                        #   <advertiser> = name, company id, or company URL
                                        #   -k <keyword> -c <countries> -e auto|api -m <max> --json
                                        #   --company-id <id> --copy-max <n> (remote sample, max 10)
liam changelog list [-t <type>] [-i <id>]           # recorded ad changes, newest first
liam changelog add -t <type> -i <id> -f <field> --after <v> [-l <label>]   # log a change made elsewhere
liam lift <level> <id> [-w <days>]      # before-vs-after performance for each recorded change
```

Periods: `last_7_days`, `last_30_days`, `last_90_days`, `month_to_date`, `last_month`.

`--account` defaults to `defaultAccountId` from config where applicable.

## Change journal & lift

Liam keeps an append-only journal of every change made to an ad entity so you can measure the
**lift** of a change: how performance differed in the window before it versus after.

- **Where it lives:** `~/.liads/changelog.jsonl` (one JSON object per line). A plain local
  file with nothing to set up. Override the path with `LIADS_CHANGELOG_PATH`.
- **Auto-capture:** every create/update Liam makes to a campaign group, campaign, or creative is
  journaled automatically (captured at the one HTTP chokepoint, so it can't be forgotten).
- **Manual entries:** log changes made outside Liam (e.g. in Campaign Manager), or attach a
  hypothesis, with `liam changelog add` / the `log_ad_change` tool. Use `-l/--label` to name the
  test (e.g. `"outcome-led headline test"`) and `--tags` to group related changes.
- **Lift:** `liam lift <level> <entityId>` (or `compute_lift`) reads the journal for that entity
  and, for each change, compares the `--window` days before (default 14) against the same window
  after, reporting before/after KPIs and per-metric deltas (CTR, CPC, conversion rate,
  cost-per-conversion, …). Recent changes get a clamped, `partial` after-window.

This is a **directional pre/post comparison, not a controlled experiment**. It is confounded by
seasonality, the LinkedIn learning phase after an edit, and any concurrent budget change, so treat
the deltas as a signal. Set `LIADS_NO_CHANGELOG=1` to disable auto-capture; journaling is
also off on hosted deploys (read-only filesystem).

## Configuration

Local config lives in `~/.liads/config.json` (mode 0600, never in the repo):

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `clientId`, `clientSecret` | LinkedIn app credentials (or `LIADS_CLIENT_ID`/`LIADS_CLIENT_SECRET`) |
| `linkedinVersion` | Pinned API version, e.g. `202605` |
| `defaultAccountId` | Ad account used when a command/brief omits one |
| `defaultConversionName` | Conversion auto-selected for new campaigns when none is given |
| `mcpAuthToken` | Bearer secret for the hosted MCP endpoint |

Hosted equivalents are the `LIADS_*` env vars plus `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` (see `.env.example`).
OAuth tokens are stored separately in `~/.liads/credentials.json`.

## Salesforce integration

Liam reads Salesforce by shelling out to the authenticated `sf` CLI (`sf data query`), so it
reuses your existing login and needs no new credentials. `audience_from_salesforce` (and
`liam audience from-salesforce`) take a SOQL query that selects an email column and turn the
result into a matched audience, closing the loop from "accounts flagged in Salesforce" to
"LinkedIn targeting." Example:

```
liam audience from-salesforce -n "Q3 target accounts" \
  -q "SELECT Email FROM Contact WHERE Account.Target_List__c = true AND Email != null"
```

## Safety

- Every campaign/creative is created **DRAFT/PAUSED**. Activation is a separate, explicit step.
- Matched-audience matching takes up to 48h, and a campaign needs ~300 matched members to serve.
- LinkedIn does not expose person-level ad-view data; cross-referencing is account/segment-level.
- Secrets never enter the repo. Local: `~/.liads`. Hosted: Vercel env vars.
