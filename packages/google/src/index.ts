/**
 * @liads/google — the Google Ads engine. Mirrors @liads/core's shape: config
 * and auth, one HTTP chokepoint, thin typed resource modules, zod schemas as
 * the single source of truth for CLI and MCP inputs.
 *
 * Safety: nothing in this package can create an enabled entity. Campaigns, ad
 * groups, and ads are created PAUSED, the schemas cannot express any other
 * status, and every write is validated server-side first with validateOnly.
 * Turning a campaign on is a human action in the Google Ads UI.
